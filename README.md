# TechneCandy #2 - The Safe

Welcome to The Safe! A coding challenge that was handmade using only the finest materials
without any artificial flavors or preservatives. Get it while it is still fresh!

**Disclaimer** Even though there are many rumors out there that the safe holds some unspeakable treasures, we have to assure you that the only treasure
inside the safe is your pride that you were able to open it!

The first part of the challenge is to figure out what programming language it was written in and what version of Java ... sorry, what version of
that language was used. A small hint I found very useful: the version is a two digit prime number that ends with 11

Now that that is out of the way, lets look at the challenge!

## The challenge

You have tree classes: Oak, Apple and Birch

Ok ... that was cheap ... soooooo, the three classes are: `Autodialer`, `Safe` and `TheJob`. The task is simple, open the safe, with the restriction that you can only
write any code in the `Autodialer:makeItRain` method. You are not allowed to write or modify any other code any where else, even in your private projects or any other projects you are working on during the period you are solving this task!
The safe is a tricky one, as it accepts any combination except the correct one. If you try to set the correct combination, then an exception is thrown.

The correct combination by the way is `16180`.

You have successfully solved the task if you can get the safe to be in `OPEN` state.
